Refactoring a legacy 2D Alien Invasion game with unit/ZOMBIE tests and Test-Driven Development (TDD). 
TDD is a feedback-driven approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing code, leading to better code quality, faster development cycles, and reduced risk of bugs!!!

## Introduction

  Alien Invasion is a 2D sprite game project from the 2nd half of the book called 'Python Crash Course', designed to aid its readers better understand how to program in python while providing a variety of projects to get started with.
With the goal of having its readers use all of the knowledge they learned from the first 10 chapters, they even provide a solution too!

  I read those same chapters, but as I was about to start the AlienIvasion project, I thought I would take it up a notch and try it with Test Driven Development!
I have experience with coding projects and programming languages due to university projects and an internship I recently aquired, so I have already been exposed to a few coding practices and techniques to make me a better Software Engineer.
That being said, the challenge I set out for myself with this project, wasn't to create the game from scratch, but to look at someone else's solution and introduce Test-Driven Development into it, accompanied by ZOMBIE Testing as well!

(ZOMBIE testing overview: https://hackernoon.com/zombie-testing-one-behavior-at-a-time-9s2m3zjo)

Benefits of TDD include:
- Early bug detection,
- Improved code quality,
- Reduced rework,
- Better design,
- Faster development, and
- living documentation


## Purpose
  Leaping right into someone else's code sounds good in my book because I practice what to expect in the workforce, but also build upon someone else's code and improve it. 
Once I hit 100% test coverage, it doesn't end there. Bugs can still linger here and there even with a 100% test coverage alone. Which is why devs say, "Zarro Boogs"! Which is why I will be using ZOMBIE testing along with TDD to aid in my goal of finding as many as I can before calling this project complete.


As I continue developing this project, my goals are to:
- ‚úÖ Introduce PyTest-based unit tests for reliable test coverage
- üîÑ Refactor legacy code to improve clarity and maintainability
- üß™ Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to new features
- üß± Explore mock testing and Zombie Testing techniques
- üß† Implement relevant design patterns to enhance structure
- ‚öôÔ∏è Optimize performance and scalability where possible
- üßë‚Äçüíª Add new features while aiming for bug-free, production-ready code‚Äîpart of my journey as a growing Software Engineer!

Fully testing a program allows a user to run into less bugs meaning there will be less unpredicatable behavior when a user interacts with it.
Of course, I would have to refactor the code a bit before starting with TDD. 
Bug free code allows you to add features with ease, is what I've learned and of course, those features will be tested and created with Test Driven Development. 

## New Game Features Wishlist
I don't want to change the original game premise. 
I will go right in and hopefully add a lot of new features and game mechanics that fit right into the original game design instead, while helping me learn new things

such as:
- bosses
- different aliens
- powerups
- a leaderboard page with real time updates
- a new game mode.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyGame
- PyTest

I cloned the project solution from Bryanmacgro's GitHub. Feel free to check it out!

At the end of the project, I hope to show the end result and how it differs from the original. :D
